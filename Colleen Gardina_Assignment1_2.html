For the past 3.5 years, I have worked as an environmental engineer for a consulting company in Hunt Valley, MD. I have recently left to pursue my MLiS degree full-time. I would love to work as a STEM or research librarian.

<p>Especially now that I am not going out as often, I have enjoyed trying new recipes at home. My favorite foods are simple. I like pizza, tacos and Mexican food, and most chocolate desserts. Although I've had fun trying new recipes, I have missed trying new restaurants with my family.</p>

<p>My hobbies include boxing, reading fantasy books, Netflix binge-watching, and playing with my dogs. I have two bird hunting dogs called wire-haired pointing griffons. Their names are Ellie and Brody. Ellie's and Brody's favorite things to do are go for hikes and swim in the reservoir near our house. I love traveling, especially to the Disney themeparks. When it is safe again, I plan to visit Tokyo Disneyland. </p><h3>List of foods you like</h3><ul><li>Pizza</li><li>Tacos</li><li>Chocolate</li></ul></body></html>
