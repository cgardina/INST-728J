	<h2><em>A More In-Depth Perspective</em></h2>

<p>
I have worked as an <strong>environmental engineer</strong> for the past 3.5 years for a consulting company in Hunt Valley, MD. I have recently left my position to pursue my MLiS degree at the <u>University of Maryland</u> full-time. 
<br>
I would love to pursue a career in STEM or research librarianship. If you want to learn more about my background, please see my <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/colleen-gardina-2678581aa">LinkedIn</a>&trade; account.

For fun, I take boxing classes, read, enjoy watching Netflix, and play with my two dogs. I have two <b>wire-haired pointing griffons.</b> Their names are Ellie and Brody. Wire-haired pointing griffons are an uncommon dog breed, bred to hunt birds. Please see a picture below.
